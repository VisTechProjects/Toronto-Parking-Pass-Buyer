# Toronto Parking Pass Buyer

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8+-blue)](https://www.python.org/) [![Selenium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Selenium-automation-green)](https://www.selenium.dev/)

Automates purchasing and refetching parking permits from [Toronto Temp parking permits](https://secure.toronto.ca/wes/eTPP/welcome.do). Fully automated from form filling to payment to PDF download, then syncs to an [e-ink display](https://github.com/VisTechProjects/parking-permit-display) via the [Android app](https://github.com/VisTechProjects/parking-permit-android).

## Why I made this
Laziness and boredom, the fact I made this readme... says it all...

Also, the City of Toronto won't let me buy a yearly permit, requires the permit location to be my permanent address, makes me repurchase every single week, and their website looks like it was built in 2005. So... City of Toronto...

- [parking-permit-android](https://github.com/VisTechProjects/parking-permit-android) - Android companion app
- [Parking permit website](https://ilovekitty.ca/parking/) - Web dashboard

This script pushes `permit.json` to the display repo, which an ESP32 e-ink display reads to show the current permit barcode.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure Google Chrome is installed and up-to-date
- If elements aren't found, the Toronto site may have changed - check XPaths
- Payment failures will fall back to manual mode
